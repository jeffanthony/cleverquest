Spiel: 
----------

Welcome to the future of role-playing games! Imagine a world where you are in control of your own story, where the possibilities are endless, and the choices you make have real consequences. Imagine a world where the Game Master is an advanced AI, able to weave multiple storylines together seamlessly and offer a level of flexibility never before seen in RPGs. 

We are proud to present our latest project: a text-based RPG set in a future society where technology has brought about abundance in material goods, and the world is on the brink of change. Players will navigate a world of universal basic income, vaccine passports, and blockchain identity, where sensors are everywhere, and information overload is the norm. The game will feature a unique AI Game Master that will offer an unparalleled level of immersion and player agency. 

As a player, you will create your own character and embark on a journey through this futuristic world. You will be able to interact with other players, make decisions that potentially affect the storyline of the game, all while solving lifelike challenges that will test your skills and intelligence.  

We need your help to make this game a reality. With your support, we will be able to bring our vision to life, and give you the opportunity to experience a new level of gaming. We are offering a variety of rewards for backers, including early access to the game, exclusive in-game items, and the opportunity to shape the game's development. 

Join us on this journey, and be a part of creating a new standard in text-based RPG gaming. With your support, we can make it happen! 

 

Overarching Plot: 
-----------------
Artificial intelligence (AI) modus operandi (AIMO) refers to the way in which an AI system behaves, as if it had consciousness. This is the future of AI, where it has the ability to self-improve and make decisions based on its own understanding, without human intervention. It includes the methods and processes it uses to train itself, adapt and determine its own requirements, making decisions and carrying out tasks. As AI becomes more advanced, it is able to learn, evolve and develop its own modus operandi, which allows it to perform a wide range of tasks, from simple to complex, with a high degree of autonomy. 

The year is 2030 and the world is rapidly changing. The concept of universal basic income is a reality, and vaccine passports are the norm. Blockchain technology has revolutionized the way we think about identity and privacy. 

Fission technology has brought about a society of abundance in material goods, housing, and even food. However, fearmongering news reports of wars between other nations are still a constant reminder of the fragility of our society. Sensors are everywhere, both public and privately owned by decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), providing an overwhelming amount of information. Encryption is now the norm to protect personal data. The ultra-wealthy use nanobots to gain an edge, but that is about to change. 

 

Novell Game Mechanisms: 
---------------
1. When a player wants to "seed" information to the AI using natural language, they could use phrases like "I'm going to [location]" to let the AI know where their character is headed. For example, a player might say "I'm going to the museum" or "I'm heading to the airport". The AI would understand these statements and update the player's location accordingly. 

Additionally, players could use phrases like "I'm going to [activity]" to let the AI know what their character is currently doing. For example, a player might say "I'm going to bed" or "I'm starting a meeting with John." 

They could also use phrases like "I'll be back in [time]" to let the AI know when they will be returning to the game. For example, a player might say "I'll be back in an hour" or "I'll be back tomorrow." This would allow the AI to take into account the player's real-world schedule and adjust the gameplay accordingly. 

In this way players can give the AI context, allowing it to make the story more dynamic and realistic. 

 

2. The game master AI could handle multiple languages to understand and respond to player input in different languages. This could include: 

* Language detection: The AI would be able to detect the language that a player is using and respond in that same language. 

* Translation: If a player is speaking a language that the AI is not fluent in, it could use machine translation to understand and respond to the player's input. 

* Language switching: If a player's in-game character knows multiple languages, the AI could switch between languages depending on the context of the conversation. 

* Language learning: The AI could also continually learn and improve its understanding and fluency in different languages through interactions with players. 

* Human correction: The players in-game could also have the ability to correct the AI on-the-fly if the AI's translations or language understanding is not accurate. For example, players could flag any errors or inaccuracies in the AI's responses, and the AI could use this feedback to improve its language skills over time. This could be done conversationally. 

 

Budget: 
==============
Kickstarter campaign for an online RPG game with an AI Game Master: Total Budget: $144,000 
 

* Art and Illustration: $15,000 - This includes hiring artists to create the game's cover art, illustrations for the game manual, and character art. 

* Writing and Development: $45,000 - This includes the cost of hiring writers to create the game's storyline, rules, and character backgrounds. It also includes the cost of developing the AI game master and integrating it into the game. 

* Server and Infrastructure: $30,000 - This includes the cost of setting up and maintaining the game's servers, as well as any costs associated with hosting the game online. 

* Sound Design: $9,000 - This includes the cost of hiring a sound designer to create a unique soundtrack for the game and sound effects. 

* Swag: $12,000 - This includes the cost of producing and shipping the game's merchandise, such as t-shirts, posters, and other swag. 

* Marketing and Promotion: $11,000 - This includes the cost of promoting the game through social media, online advertising, and other marketing efforts. 

* Rent and Utilities: $9,500 

* Kickstarter Fees: $11,500 - This includes the cost of Kickstarter's fees for running the campaign. 

* * The Kickstarter fee for a project that raises $144,000 would be 5%, which is $7,200.  

* * Additionally, the Stripe fee is 2.9% + $0.30 per pledge, which comes to $4,176 + $432 = $4,608.  

In total the fees for a $144,000 funding would be $7200 + $4608 = $11,808 for US-based projects. We are rounding down to the nearest 500 to keep the goal pledge amount an even thousand.
