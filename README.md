## Eventually use AI

There are several ways that artificial intelligence (AI) could potentially be used to automate GMing in a tabletop RPG like D&D:

NPC generation: AI could be used to generate NPCs with different characteristics, personalities, and backgrounds. This could save the GM time in preparing for a session and make it easier to populate the game world with a diverse cast of characters.

Encounter generation: AI could be used to generate encounters for the PCs to encounter, including the types of enemies or challenges they will face and the tactics those enemies might use. This could allow the GM to spend more time on other aspects of preparation, or even generate encounters on the fly during a session.

Rule adjudication: AI could be used to help the GM keep track of the rules of the game and make decisions about how they should be applied. This could be particularly useful for new GMs who are still learning the ins and outs of the game.

Story generation: AI could potentially be used to help the GM create a story for the PCs to follow, including generating plot hooks and events that the PCs can encounter. This could be especially useful for GMs who are running one-shot games or are looking for inspiration for their campaigns.

Item generation: AI could be used to generate new items for the PCs to find or purchase during the game. This could include magical items with unique abilities, as well as more mundane items like weapons and armor. The AI could take into account the characters' level, the game world, and other factors when generating items, making it easier for the GM to come up with appropriate rewards for the PCs.
